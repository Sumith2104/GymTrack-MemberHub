/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for GymTrack Lite.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private data (check-ins, notifications)
 * stored under the `/users/{userId}` path. Global data (announcements) is publicly readable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /members/{memberId}: Stores member profiles. Accessible only to authenticated users.
 * - /users/{userId}/checkIns/{checkInId}: Stores check-in records for individual users.
 * - /announcements/{announcementId}: Stores global announcements. Publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/notifications/{notificationId}: Stores notifications for individual users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Members can only access their own check-ins and notifications.
 * - Announcements are publicly readable but not writable by clients (backend managed).
 * - Member profiles are only accessible to autheticated users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `memberId` field in `CheckIn` and `Notification` documents is used to enforce ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Announcements are stored in a separate top-level collection to allow public read access without
 * compromising the security of private user data.
